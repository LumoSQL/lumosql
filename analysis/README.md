# Statistical analysis of LumoSQL Benchmarking

This is a program and presentation webpage for the [R statistical
language](https://www.r-project.org/). To make this work, you must first
install R on a server somewhere, and then upload the contents of 
/contrasts and /shiny to the web path of the server.

We need to improve the R installation and operation instructions here.
R is not the easiest thing to install, but it does appear to be exactly
what is needed to process the large amount of multi-way benchmarking data
generated by LumoSQL.
