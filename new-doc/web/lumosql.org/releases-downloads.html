<b>NOTE - This is a dummy page at the moment. None of the links work. If you have feedback we'd love to hear it. LumoSQL is tricky to explain simply, and this dummy page is to experiment with how a public release of LumoSQL should be presented. We assume that if you want to download LumoSQL you know it is a drop-in replacement for the SQLite library (eg /usr/lib/libsqlite3.so depending on your operating system) and that you are either writing an application that uses the sqlite3 library, or, you are using the commandline version (eg /usr/bin/sqlite3). We would also hope and expect LumoSQL to be packaged in operating systems, so that means the packagers have to understand how we do LumoSQL releases.</b>
<p>
<p>
<p>LumoSQL is available in several ways, depending on your needs. We will not be providing binaries until LumoSQL v1.0 is released, so your choices are to get <em>all</em> the source for generating 700+ versions and combinations, <em>or</em>, to select just the sources that LumoSQL tools generate relevant to your needs. None are large downloads, and the <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking">Not-forking</a> tool does cache downloads and reconstruct trees from local versions as much as possible.</p>
<p>
If you have problems getting a LumoSQL release you can <a href="mailto:authors@lumosql.org">contact us</a> and we will do our best.

<h2 style="color: #5e9ca0;">LumoSQL Trunk</h2>
<p>'Trunk' means the same as 'master', 'default' or 'HEAD'. It's the current latest development version.
<p>If you are a developer curious about which of the many combinations might be right for your application, then you want the ability to generate everything the LumoSQL tools can give you. This includes any version of modified SQLite with encryption, privacy, backend, benchmarking etc features. For this you will need the <strong>Fossil</strong> trunk SCM tree, or its <strong>Git</strong> mirror, or the <strong>Trunk source tarball</strong>:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
	<td><a href="https://fossil-scm.org/src/lumosql">LumoSQL trunk</a></td>

<p><em>fossil clone https://lumosql/src/lumosql<br />cd lumosql</em><br /><em>fossil update</em> # for current trunk<br /><em>fossil update version-0.7 # for a specific LumoSQL version</em><br /><em>fossil tag list | grep version # to list all versions</em></p>

<h2 style="color: #5e9ca0;">Downloads for Specific use cases</h2>
<p>You might just be interested in one aspect of LumoSQL. There are still many combinations of trees, but still there will be far fewer options. All of the following are the trees as generated by the current trunk of LumoSQL, rather than any particular release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="1" style="width:80%">
<tbody>
 <tr>
   <th style="width:60%">LumoSQL generated product</th>
   <th>Download versions</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>LumoSQL Flavour 1 - SQLite modifications, native BTree.</b> This is SQLite modified to have hidden columns and other metadata to support per-row checksums, per-row encryption and per-table encryption. An ordinary unmodified SQLite binary can open and operate on databases created by binaries compiled in these trees. However only the code in these trees has the additional commands required to see and manipulate this metadata.</td>
<td><label for="mod-native-version">Select your modified SQLite version: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</label><select id="mod-native-version" name="one">
<option value="3.38.0">3.38.0</option>
<option value="3.37.0">3.37.0</option>
<option value="3.36.0">3.36.0</option>
</select></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>LumoSQL Flavour 2 - SQLite modifications, LMDB backend.</b> This is SQLite with hidden columns and other metadata just as in Flavour 1. The key-value store is also LMDB, so unmodified SQLite binaries cannot open databases these trees create. The new SQLite commands work exactly as for Flavour 1. LMDB inspection tools can however see databases created by binaries made from these trees.</td>
<td><label for="mod-lmdb">Select an SQLite+LMDB version: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</label><select id="mod-lmdb" name="two">
<option value="3.38.0+0.9.0">SQLite 3.38.0 + LMDBv0.9.0</option>
<option value="3.37.0+0.9.0">SQLite 3.37.0 + LMDBv0.9.0</option>
<option value="3.36.0+0.9.0">SQLite 3.36.0 + LMDBv0.9.0</option>
</select></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>LumoSQL Flavour 3 - Unmodified SQLite, LMDB.</b> This is ordinary SQLite in every way, except the key-value store is LMDB. These trees help you answer the question "what if I used a 21st-century memory-mapped database model instead of a 20th-centurl Write-ahead log?" The answer isn't necessarily obvious, but it is a <em>very good question you can now ask with minimal effort.</em> </td>
<td><label for="mod-lmdb">SQLite+LMDB versions: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</label><select id="unmod-lmdb" name="tthree">
<option value="3.38.0+0.9.0">SQLite 3.38.0 + LMDBv0.9.0</option>
<option value="3.37.0+0.9.0">SQLite 3.37.0 + LMDBv0.9.0</option>
<option value="3.36.0+0.9.0">SQLite 3.36.0 + LMDBv0.9.0</option>
</select></td>

<h2 style="color: #5e9ca0;">But LumoSQL is confusing! What should I choose?</h2>

Well, yes, it's a lot! That's why we have helpful <a href="https://analysis.lumosql.org/">charts and graphs</a> created by our statistics team. 
<p>
We do have some recommendations for common use cases:

<ul>
	<li>Use case 1: XXX XXX XX XX XX</li>
	<li>Use case 1: XXX XXX XX XX XX</li>
	<li>Use case 1: XXX XXX XX XX XX</li>
</ul>
