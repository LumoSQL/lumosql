# Building and Installing LumoSQL


## Linux/Unix


To get LumoSQL for a Linux system follow [this documentation](https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/tip/README.md#build-environment-and-dependencies).

For build and benchmark options read [here](https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/tip/doc/lumo-build-benchmark.md).


[Build and test LumoSQL](./3.5-lumo-test-build.md)


The maintainers are test building LumoSQL on Debian, Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu.
Container images with the dependencies installed are available at
<https://quay.io/repository/keith_maxwell/lumosql-build> and the build steps are
in <https://github.com/maxwell-k/containers>.

# Running LumoSQL

libraries and a command line shell are built with the following names:

    ```lumosql```

    This is the command line shell. It operates identically to the SQLite sqlite3 shell.

    ```liblumosql```

    This is the library that provides the LumoSQL SQL interface. It is the equivalent of the SQLite libsqlite3 library.
