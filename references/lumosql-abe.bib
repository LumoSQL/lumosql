  abstract = {In several distributed systems a user should only be able to access data if a user posses a certain set of credentials or attributes. Currently, the only method for enforcing such policies is to employ a trusted server to store the data and mediate access control. However, if any server storing the data is compromised, then the confidentiality of the data will be compromised. In this paper we present a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data that we call ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption. By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept confidential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks. Previous attribute-based encryption systems used attributes to describe the encrypted data and built policies into user's keys; while in our system attributes are used to describe a user's credentials, and a party encrypting data determines a policy for who can decrypt. Thus, our methods are conceptually closer to traditional access control methods such as role-based access control (RBAC). In addition, we provide an implementation of our system and give performance measurements.},

  abstract = {Driven by the increased consciousness in data ownership and privacy, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have become a popular tool to convince a third party of the truthfulness of a statement without disclosing any further information. As ZKPs are rather complex to design, frameworks that transform high-level languages into ZKPs have been proposed. We propose Circuitree, a Datalog reasoner in zero-knowledge. Datalog is a high-level declarative logic language that is generally used for querying. Furthermore, as a logic language, it can also be used to solve logic problems. An application using Circuitree can efficiently generate ZKPs, based on Datalog rules and encrypted data, to prove that a certain conclusion follows from a Datalog ruleset and encrypted input data. Compared to existing frameworks, which generally use their own limited imperative languages, Circuitree uses an existing high-level declarative language. We point out several applications for Circuitree, including EU Digital COVID Certificates and privacy-preserving access control for peer-to-peer (p2p) networks. Circuitree’s performance is evaluated for access control in a p2p network. First results show that our approach allows for fast proofs and proof verification for this application.},

One drawback of encrypting data, is that it can be selectively shared only at a coarse-grained level (i.e., giving another party your private key). We develop a new cryptosystem for fine-grained sharing of encrypted data that we call Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE). In our cryptosystem, ciphertexts are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with access structures that control which ciphertexts a user is able to decrypt. We demonstrate the applicability of our construction to sharing of audit-log information and broadcast encryption. Our construction supports delegation of private keys which subsumes Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE).},

The model is then applied to represent access control policy in a mental health system. In the first part of the paper, extensions to the schematic protection model (SPM) are presented. The authentication and revocation extensions are independent of one another in the sense that each one affects a different part of the decision algorithm. The extensions comprise a modification of the syntax to be able to represent the new concepts and, more importantly, a modification of the decision algorithm for the safety problem to take these changes into account. We introduce the concept of conditional tickets and use it to provide authentication. Apart from this, we have found this concept to be useful in modeling systems. Hence we have separated this (syntactical) issue from the definition of the new algorithm. The second part considers the access policy for a mental health application. We have used the extensions of SPM to model part of this access policy. Even with our extensions, SPM still remains a monotonic model, where rights can be removed only in very special cases, and this makes it impossible to represent all the aspects of the problem. Other than to serve as an example for the extensions we propose, the paper also helps to separate aspects of this access control policy which are inherently monotonic from parts which are defined in a non-monotonic way, but can still be represented in a monotonic model.},

  author    = "Herranz, Javier",
  abstract  = "In this study, the author formally proves that designing
               attribute-based encryption schemes cannot be easier than
               designing identity-based encryption schemes. In more detail,
               they show how an attribute-based encryption scheme which admits,
               at least, and policies can be combined with a
               collision-resistant hash function to obtain an identity-based
               encryption scheme. Even if this result may seem natural, not
               surprising at all, it has not been explicitly written anywhere,
               as far as they know. Furthermore, it may be an unknown result
               for some people: Odelu et al. in 2016 and 2017 have proposed
               both an attribute-based encryption scheme in the discrete
               logarithm setting, without bilinear pairings, and an
               attribute-based encryption scheme in the RSA setting, both
               admitting and policies. If these schemes were secure, then by
               using the implication proved in this study, one would obtain
               secure identity-based encryption schemes in both the RSA and the
               discrete logarithm settings, without bilinear pairings, which
               would be a breakthrough in the area. Unfortunately, the author
               presents here complete attacks of the two schemes proposed by
