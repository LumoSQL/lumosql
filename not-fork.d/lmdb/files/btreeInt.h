/* A Btree handle
**
** A database connection contains a pointer to an instance of
** this object for every database file that it has open.  This structure
** is opaque to the database connection.  The database connection cannot
** see the internals of this structure and only deals with pointers to
** this structure.
**
** For some database files, the same underlying database cache might be 
** shared between multiple connections.  In that case, each connection
** has it own instance of this object.  But each instance of this object
** points to the same BtShared object.  The database cache and the
** schema associated with the database file are all contained within
** the BtShared object.
**
** All fields in this structure are accessed under sqlite3.mutex.
** The pBt pointer itself may not be changed while there exists cursors 
** in the referenced BtShared that point back to this Btree since those
** cursors have to go through this Btree to find their BtShared and
** they often do so without holding sqlite3.mutex.

/*
** An instance of this object represents a single database file.
** 
** A single database file can be in use at the same time by two
** or more database connections.  When two or more connections are
** sharing the same database file, each connection has it own
** private Btree object for the file and each of those Btrees points
** to this one BtShared object.  BtShared.nRef is the number of
** connections currently sharing this database file.
**
** Fields in this structure are accessed under the BtShared.mutex
** mutex, except for nRef and pNext which are accessed under the
** global SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER mutex.  The pPager field
** may not be modified once it is initially set as long as nRef>0.
** The pSchema field may be set once under BtShared.mutex and
** thereafter is unchanged as long as nRef>0.
**
** isPending:
**
**   If a BtShared client fails to obtain a write-lock on a database
**   table (because there exists one or more read-locks on the table),
**   the shared-cache enters 'pending-lock' state and isPending is
**   set to true.
**
**   The shared-cache leaves the 'pending lock' state when either of
**   the following occur:
**
**     1) The current writer (BtShared.pWriter) concludes its transaction, OR
**     2) The number of locks held by other connections drops to zero.
**
**   while in the 'pending-lock' state, no connection may start a new
**   transaction.
**
**   This feature is included to help prevent writer-starvation.
