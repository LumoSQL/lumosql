<p>LumoSQL is not a fork of SQLite. LumoSQL integrates several bodies of code
including SQLite into a new database. The idea of building on SQLite isn't new.
The reach and breadth of the SQLite code is astonishing and far more than the
LumoSQL project realised at the beginning. Before LumoSQL nobody has tried to
document this as one whole.</p>
<h1 id="the-sqlite-landscape"><a class="header" href="#the-sqlite-landscape">The SQLite Landscape</a></h1>
<p>The Internet runs on data stored in rows, ie Relational Databases (RDBMS). There are 
many exceptions and alternatives but RDBMS are where the deciding data is stored including:</p>
<ul>
<li>in routers that direct internet traffic</li>
<li>in mobile phones that enable the user to navigate the internet</li>
<li>business applications or those that deal with reconciling important numbers</li>
<li>in millions of everyday web applications, from Wikipedia to ticket booking systems</li>
</ul>
<p>The most widely-used relational database is almost certainly SQLite, and nearly
all SQLite usage is in embedded devices, frequently with internet access as the
Internet of Things. The question &quot;How widely-used is SQLite?&quot; is addressed in specific
section below.</p>
<p>In addition there are SQLite-derived projects that address traditional online
database use cases in a similar way only in a tiny fraction (4%-10%) of size of
code. SQLite sticks to its strict original project definition. LumoSQL seeks to
be still rigorous and also inclusive and accepting of the many new
SQLite-based features fragmented across the web.</p>
<p>The databases to compare LumoSQL against are those which together are the
most-used on the internet today: </p>
<ul>
<li>Oracle MySQL - open source, with closed source licensing available, ubiquitous on the internet</li>
<li>MariaDB - a mostly-compatible fork of MySQL, seemingly taking over from MySQL on the internet</li>
<li>Postgresql - open source, highly compliant with SQL standards,</li>
<li>Oracle's traditional RDBMs - the closed source database that makes its owners the most money</li>
<li>Microsoft SQL Server - ubiquitous in business applications, less common on the internet </li>
<li>SQLite - source code freely available, highly compliant with most SQL standards</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are online databases, while SQLite is embedded - more on that below.</p>
<h2 id="lumosql-and-the-sqlite-project"><a class="header" href="#lumosql-and-the-sqlite-project">LumoSQL and The SQLite Project</a></h2>
<p>This section pulls out distinctive features of the sqlite.org project that
matter to LumoSQL.  Some are negative features to which LumoSQL wants to
respond by way of an improvement or extension, but others are more like a
spring that gives LumoSQL a great start in new use cases. Some of these points
are mentioned by D Richard Hipp in his <a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/201">2016 Changelog Podcast Interview</a>.</p>
<p><strong>sqlite.org is a responsive and responsible upstream</strong>, for issues they feel
are in scope. For example, see section 4.1.4 in
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html">https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html</a> where Manuel Rigger is credited for his
work in raising many dozens of bugs, which as can be seen at
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?y=t&amp;u=mrigger&amp;n=all">https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?y=t&amp;u=mrigger&amp;n=all</a> have been addressed
promptly. LumoSQL should not fork SQLite, partly because the developers are doing a 
very good job at maintaining the things they care about, and partly because SQLite has a high 
profile and attracts technical review.</p>
<p><strong>Sqlite.org is entirely focussed on its existing scope and traditional user
needs</strong> and <a href="https://sqlite.org/about.html">SQLite imposes strict limits</a> for
example “Think of SQLite not as a replacement for Oracle but as a replacement for
fopen()” which eliminates many of the possibilities LumoSQL is now exploring
that go beyond any version of fopen(). Many things that SQLite can used
for are <a href="https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html">declared out of scope</a> by the
SQLite project including those that are high concurrency, write-intensive, or
networked. LumoSQL feels there is a tension between this scope for SQLite and
the 5G IoT world very many applications are all three, and many SQLite
deployments are tending towards disregarding the warnings from the SQLite
project. </p>
<p><strong>Sqlite has a very strict and reliable view on maintaining backwards
compatibility both binary and API (except when it comes to encryption, see
further down.)</strong> The Sqlite foundation aims to keep SQLite3 interfaces and
formats stable until the year 2050, according to Richard Hipp in the
podcast interview, as once requested by an airframe construction company
(Airbus). Whatever happens in years to come SQLite has definitely delivered on
this to date. This means that there are many things SQLite cannot do which
LumoSQL can, and it also means that LumoSQL needs to suppor strict
compatibility with SQLite3 interfaces and formats at least as an option if not
the default.</p>
<p><strong>Sqlite.org not entirely an open project.</strong> No code is accepted from contributors
external to the company HWACI, which is owned by D Richard Hipp, the original
author and lead of SQLite. From the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html">SQLite copyright page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright, the
project does not accept patches. If you would like to make a suggested change,
and include a patch as a proof-of-concept, that would be great.  However please
do not be offended if we rewrite your patch from scratch.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That fact is not hidden in any way, and there have been many years of
successful SQLite use on this basis. It is definitely not acceptable under the
Next Generation Internet initiative nor (quite possibly) under draft and
current EU laws or at least recommendations, as discussed elsewhere in SQLite
documentation. On the other hand, there is a <a href="https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/contribute.wiki">contribution
policy</a>
. LumoSQL is a fully open project, and since it started in 2019 not 1999,
LumoSQL does not have to navigate historical decisions in the way SQLite does.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sqlite.com/lts.html">SQLite Long Term Support</a> page states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In addition to supporting SQLite through the year 2050, the developers also
promise to keep the SQLite <a href="https://sqlite.com/cintro.html">C-language API</a> and
<a href="https://sqlite.com/fileformat2.html">on-disk format</a> fully backwards
compatible. This means that applications written to use SQLite today should be
able to link against and use future versions of SQLite released decades in the
future.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as the success of this policy and its obvious advantages, there are some 
serious problems with it too:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>this kind of backwards-compatibility was one of the problems that led
to Microsoft Windows stagnation for years, see <a href="https://joomla.digital-peak.com/blog/178-the-case-against-backward-compatibility">The Case Against
Backwards Compatibility</a>.
The problem isn't clear-cut, as shown by <a href="https://www.dpdk.org/blog/2019/10/10/why-is-abi-stability-important/">Why is ABI Stability Important?</a>
and Greg Kroah-Hartman's paper <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/stable-api-nonsense.rst">Stable API Nonsense</a>,
noting that the Linux distribution companies such as Red Hat charge money to maintain a time-limited
stable API.  LumoSQL has the luxury of choosing what extensions to stable formats and APIs to introduce, and how.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since SQLite crypto implementation details are secret, any encrypted database 
created by the official closed-source SQLite is almost certainly incompatible 
with any other encryption project by third parties, despite file format compatibility 
being a major feature of SQLite. Yet with encryption being a requirement for 
many applications, this means there is no guarantee of SQLite file format
compatibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this rigid rule becomes difficult when it comes to a long-term
storage format discussions.  See below for discussion of how the
SQLite binary format has almost zero internal integrity checking.
LumoSQL aims to add options to address this problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sqlite is less open source than it appears</strong>. The existence of so many SQLite
spin-offs is evidence that SQLite code is highly available. However there are
several aspects of SQLite that mean it cannot be considered open source, in
ways that are increasingly important in the 21st century:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Public domain is not is not recognised in some countries such as
Germany and Australia, which means that legal certainty is not
possible for users in these countries who need it or want it. Public
Domain is not a valid grant of right, which is why it is not one of
the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">Open Source Initiative licenses</a> nor
does it appear on the <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/">SPDX License List</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sqlite.org charge USD6000 for “perpetual right-to-use for the SQLite source
code&quot;, and implies that this right-to-use grants legal benefits. This is an
additional reason why the SQLite public domain licensing approach cannot be
open source, because you have to pay money in order to be sure where you stand.
Paying money for open source is encouraged throughout the open source movement,
however if that casts doubt on the validity of the open source license then it
cannot be open source in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/th3.html">sqlite.org states</a>, the most important test harness is only available commercially. 
This is perfectly legal, but is definitely not the way open source projects
generally behave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only supported encryption code is closed source, and even the mailing list 
for discussing this is not public. This is not expected behaviour for an open 
source project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This really matters, because in an analogous move, MariaDB now publish some of their
cryptographic and network scaling code under their <a href="https://mariadb.com/bsl-faq-mariadb/">Business Source License</a>
which requires &quot;Power Users&quot; to pay.  These pressures are not compatible with
modern open source and LumoSQL wants to provide an alternative.</p>
<p><strong>SQLite Code has Many Independent Downstreams</strong> Multiple front ends, backends
and network replication, clustering and encryption solutions exist today. This
is all code that appears to be working, or at least it has not obviously
decayed even if it might not work as advertised, and some it is very actively
developed and supported. Much of this code has been inspected to a first level
by LumoSQL, some of it has been built and run. Just because the foregoing can
be made to work in a demonstration does not mean that it is suitable for
production, nor that it should be part of LumoSQL design. But it speaks of a
very strong demand for more features, and a rich pool of experimentation to
learn from. This is covered in more detail in the next section. </p>
<p><strong>Sqlite file format does not have technical or organisational longevity
built-in</strong> Sqlite.org commit to supporting the on-disk file format until 2050,
without evidence of an enduring legal body. Similarly, claims are made for the
reliability of the on-disk format even though there are virtually no intergity
measures built in.  As can be seen from <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html">the published
specification</a> the use of checksums is
limited to pages in the writeback journal, and WAL records, and one 32-bit
integer for when the official closed source encryption is used. Therefore file
format provides no general means of validating the data it contains. It would
be possible to extend the file format in a backwards-compatible manner to
include such checks, but that does not appear to have been discussed or
suggested. This does not provide modern standards of reliable at-rest storage,
transport and archiving, and it does not meet minimum privacy standards
including those mandated by law in many countries, especially the EU.
sqlite.org is not unique in this, it is only fair to say that other SQL
databases implement this feature awkwardly or not at all, and that it is
particularly obvious in the case of SQLite because it an embedded local on-disk
database library. SQLite could be the first database to have a modern reliable
on-disk format, and it would not be difficult to make it so except for promises 
not to break bit-for-bit compatibility. This issue is dealt with in more detail in 
<a href="./lumo-architecture">LumoSQL architecture</a> and <a href="./lumo-implementation.html">implementation</a> documentation.</p>
<p><strong>the current Sqlite on-disk file format may be less robust than it seems</strong>.
Unscientific ad-hoc enquiries indicate that many IT professionals are familiar
with SQLite file corruption. Examples of ad-hoc enquiries are: asking for a
show of hands in a room of developers, speaking to the maintainers of SQLite
file inspection tools, and chatting to Android developers.  The LumoSQL team as
of March 2020 are looking at how to artificially create crashes and corruptions
as part of testing (and perhaps benchmarking).</p>
<h1 id="sqlite-downstreams"><a class="header" href="#sqlite-downstreams">SQLite Downstreams</a></h1>
<p>There is still a lot for LumoSQL to explore because there is just so much code, but
as of March 2020 we are confident code could be assembled from here and there
on the internet to demonstrate the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQLite with Berkely bdb backend</li>
<li>SQLite with LevelDB backend</li>
<li>SQLite with network access from quite a few projects, only some of them listed</li>
<li>SQLite with MySQL-compatible frontend, from Oracle</li>
<li>SQLite with MySQL-compatible frontend, from Bedrock</li>
<li>SQLite with LMDB at WAL-level and then replicated LMDB with consensus, from ActorDB</li>
<li>SQLite with private blockchain-esque for fast replication to 6-8 nodes, from Bedrock</li>
<li>SQLite with GIS extensions</li>
<li>SQLite accessible locally over ODBC</li>
<li>SQLite with at-rest encryption in many different ways</li>
</ul>
<p>And plenty more. </p>
<p>Due to the fragmented nature of SQLite landscape, what we <em>cannot</em> demonstrate is:</p>
<ul>
<li>APIs for the above features in the same codebase</li>
<li>any of these interesting features running together in the same
binary or using the same database files</li>
<li>consolidated contact, code curation, bug tracking, licensing across
these features and projects</li>
</ul>
<p>and that is why there really isn't an SQLite ecosystem, just a landscape. </p>
<p>For those users that even realise there are extended feature versions of SQLite
around, they have to pick and choose which of these features they want, and
usually that means going without some other feature, and it just has a chaotic
feel to it. On the other hand, while SQLite has achieved so much, there are
compelling reasons to look for an alternative. LumoSQL aims to be that
alternative.</p>
<h1 id="how-widely-used-is-sqlite-compared-to-others"><a class="header" href="#how-widely-used-is-sqlite-compared-to-others">How Widely-used is SQLite Compared to Others?</a></h1>
<p>It is easy to establish that SQLite3 is deployed in billions of applications around the world, and as
sqlite.org has showed it is easy to <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">credibly quote very large deployment numbers</a>.</p>
<p>But what of SQLite in relation to the databases it can be reasonably compared
to, especially as the use cases for SQLite have become so broad?  There isn't a good 
answer, and this is something that LumoSQL hopes to change over time as it gains 
features that feel familiar to users outside traditional embedded development.</p>
<p>SQLite is considered by many to not be database at all, any more than bdb (the
original Unix bdb, as still used by a diminishing number of applications) or
LMDB. These are all embeddable database libraries. That affects how we measure
popularity. This view is also easy to challenge on technical grounds, if the 
only difference is closeness of the coupling between the application and the database.</p>
<p>The difference in measurement between the online databases and sqlite is significant in these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measures of database popularity with developers don’t map well to a database library (see
the widely-regarded <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking">https://db-engines.com/en/ranking</a> ) because embedded applications use
fewer database developers than cloud and other higher-level applications. The commercial
value is concentrated in different parts of the stack for these two use cases, although not the
commercial risk.</li>
<li>Industry surveys are indicative but well short of science-based methods, and almost never
focussed on embeddable databases and yet nevertheless SQLite is usually included. For
example <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/devecosystem-2018/">6000 developers surveyed by Jetbrains</a> and this <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2019/3/6/2019-database-trends-sql-vs-nosql-top-databases-single-vs-mu.html">Developer Week survey</a></li>
<li>Being an embeddable library, SQLite is not intended for use in cloud applications and the
like, and therefore most surveys of databases do not cover them. As many people including
the SQLite developers point out, it is possible to run a web application off SQLite just as
much as it is possible to run an email server using Sendmail. Readers of this document are
unlikely to be confused that either of these activities are a good idea.</li>
<li>In contrast, embedded databases are rarely addressed as a sector because the embedded
development industry does not tend to be very interested in how data is stored.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Not counting bdb. We can reasonably discount bdb as a currently-relevant database, because its
prevalence is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_DB#Past_users">decreasing rapidly</a>
and noting the heading “Deprecated in favour of LMDB”, and also looking at the reactions
worldwide when Oracle changed the license of the bdb code. bdb is being erased from the world of
free software applications.)</p>
