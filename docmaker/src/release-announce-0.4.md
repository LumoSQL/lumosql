# LumoSQL Database v0.4 Released

*10th January 2021*

With version 0.4, LumoSQL infrastructure has come of age:

* The benchmarking tools are generally useful for SQLite users, including vanilla SQLite
* The build tool is now much more consistent and reliable, and written in Tcl
* The example benchmarking report tool is more comprehensive (also written in Tcl)
* [not-forking](https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking) is much improved, and ready for use in other projects

The [LumoSQL Project README](https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/tip/README.md) contains a much more 
useful introduction and quickstart. 

The [Build and Benchmarking](https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/tip/doc/lumo-build-benchmark.md) documentation is comprehensive.

The [benchmark filter documentation](https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/tip/doc/lumo-benchmark-filter.md) is comprehensive.

As specific targets for the next LumoSQL version some 
[LumoSQL Limitations](https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/doc/tip/README.md#limitations-of-lumosql)
are listed in the README. Otherwise all the LumoSQL goals continue to roll
along, including varying forms of encryption, verification and validation.
