Not-Forking Upstream Source Code Tracker
========================================

Not-forking tool is a code integration tool that offers unprecedented flexibility (patch/sed/diff/cp/mv) in making changes to codebases and tracking them over new releases of source software. 

It was developed to facilitate LumoSQL, which combines SQLite and LMDB code for all available versions of SQLite and LMDB. 

Not-Forking is released as a separate software tool and it's available for use in other proects. Documentation on Not-Forking is maintained separately. Read [about Not-Forking](https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking/doc/trunk/README.md) and [full documentation](https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking/doc/trunk/doc/not-forking.md) on using the tool.
