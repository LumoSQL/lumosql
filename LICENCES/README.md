# Licensing

This directory contains the licence which applies to all material in the LumoSQL project.

# MIT Licence

The [MIT Licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) applies to all
files in this project. The MIT licence is the most-widely used Open Source
licence, including by some of the world's largest companies. The MIT licence
grants everyone the right to use the code for any purpose under copyright law.
Every file should have a copyright statement at the top and also a 
[Software Package Data Exchange](https://spdx.dev) machine-readable header, but even if
it doesn't, the MIT licence still applies. It also applies to any file which is 
not clearly code, such as configuration or input data.

The [LumoSQL Documentation](https://web.lumosql.org) 
is also generally covered by this MIT licence. There are documentation-specific
licences and we will adopt one of them if the MIT licence ever becomes a problem.

To even further avoid potential misunderstanding, we maintain the site
[license.lumosql.org](https://license.lumosql.org) with the full text of the MIT Licence.
