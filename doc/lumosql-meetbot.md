# Automated Meeting Notes With lumosql-meetbot

We use [HcoopMeetbot](https://hcoop-meetbot.readthedocs.io) to make irc meetings simpler and easier.

Normal irc chat is ignored by the bot, but chat that tagged as part of meeting
goes in the notes. Any user on the #lumosql channel can participate in a
meeting, or call one.

Meetings notes automatically appear in the [Meetbot log directory](https://lumosql.org/meetings) as soon as 
the meeting is finished.

This Meetbot helps us remember the important information immediately, and the action items.

# How to Use the Meetbot

If you enter the #lumosql chat room on the [libera chat
network](https://libera.chat Libera), you will see there is a logged-in user
called "lumosql-meetbot". This is a bot, and its purpose is to hang around waiting until someone
says "#startmeeting" in the chat. From then on, it listens for more instructions preceded with "#".

You can read all the details in the help page above, but in brief the commands we mostly need are:

```
#startmeeting       anyone can start a meeting
#here               list yourself as an attendee
#topic              here is a new topic
#info               bullet item under the topic
#link               this URL gets added to the topic
#action <nick>      assign an action item to user <nick> eg "#action Bj√∂rn to make the coffee"
#accepted           log an agreement that we have made, eg "#accepted we are all going home now"
#endmeeting         close the meeting, update the HTML files and both the formatted minutes and raw log magically appear in a few seconds

    also

#commands           get a list of all the valid commands, and be reminded of the URL of the help page.
```

There is also the ability to vote and other facilities. It's a great tool, thanks to
[Kenneth J. Pronovici](https://github.com/pronovic) and others.

You can address the bot directly and chat with it, including by the shortcut "@
\<text\>". You'll find out about that in the online help.

>    Obviously, chat in #lumosql is covered by the [LumoSQL Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md), which says "be a decent person".
