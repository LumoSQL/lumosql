      Lumions: Portable, Secure, Unique, Updatable Data Primitives
              draft-shearer-desmet-calvelli-lumionsrfc-00

Abstract

   This memo defines Lumions, a new kind of secure, unique data
   encapsulation primitive designed for reliable, fine-grained movements
   of data between Internet-of-Things devices and multiple clouds.
   Lumions are also compatible with decentralised, distributed key
   management.

1.  Introduction

   A Lumion is a one-dimensional array of data which is at minimum
   encrypted, signed, checksummed, versioned, binary and universally
   unique with discriminated access control, stored in network byte
   order.

   In addition a Lumion may optionally be encrypted with a public/
   private key system such that it can be updated by anyone possessing
   the correct key and conformant software.  There are many useful
   properties possessed by a Lumion explained in this memo.

   Situations where Lumion properties are helpful include internet-
   connected devices such as mobile phones; transparency requirements
   related to privacy; and data portability requirements between clouds.

   A new media type "application/lumion" is defined as a helpful hint
   for high-level applications.

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Definitions

   A Lumion Generator is software that can produce a Lumion for any
   supplied raw data.  A Generator may be standalone or built into eg a
   database.  A Lumion Generator must also be able to read Lumions, and
   is a full implementation of this RFC.

   A Lumion Reader is software that can access at least some data inside
   a Lumion, provided it has a key to do so, where a key is required by
   a particular Lumion.  A Lumion Reader implements some of the
   verification and reading functionality in this RFC.

   A Lumion Recogniser is very simple software, perhaps a function or a
   script, that can detect the unique naming convention used by Lumions
   as defined in this RFC, and extract the universally unique identifier
   used by a particular Lumion.  A Recogniser can extract Lumions from
   non-Lumion data, and search for a particular Lumion.  A Recogniser
   will not be able to reliably determine whether any given Lumion is
   valid or not.

   A Lumion consists of:

   *  payload data, an arbitary binary string of arbitary length less
      than 2^64 bytes
   *  payload metadata, such as a checksum specific to the payload
   *  other metadata, such as a checksum for the lumion as a whole

   Any of the three types of data may be in plain text, although they
   usually will not be because much of the value of a Lumion is in its
   encrypted properties.

   Data in a Lumion may be automatically generated by one of these kinds
   of processes:

   *  cryptographic checksums
   *  symmetric encryption
   *  public key encryption
   *  public key signing
   *  one-way hashes appended to a name-based uniqueness algorithm

   For each of these there are multiple possible ciphers and
   implementation techniques.

   Portability requires that data is stored in Network Byte Order.

3.  Properties of Lumions

   Non-repudiable.  The original key authority might be unreliable and
   transient (because the phone got swallowed by a diprodoton) but a
   cluster of rows can definitely be identified as having the same
   original source.

   Self-contained security: no external key authority or integrity
   authority is needed.  Discriminated access control is provided solely
   from the information within the Lumion.

   Corruption can always be detected.

   Totally portable across architectures, networks, storage systems
   without losing or gaining any information.

   Time-travelling.  This is because Lumions have a version number, so
   they can be viewed as snapshots in time.  They can also be viewed as
   time sequence data, if the Lumion Generator intended to produce that.

   A Lumion can be operated on by any compliant software.

10.  Security Considerations

   While a valid umion is entirely self-contained from a security point
   of view, it is important to remember that Lumions by design cannot
   support anonymity.  Transparency and traceability is vital to the
   Lumion concept, which is why it has a UUID.

12.  IANA Considerations

   This memo calls for IANA to register a new MIME content-type
   application/pidf+xml, per [MIME].

   The registration template for this is below.

12.1.  Content-type registration for 'application/lumion'

   To: ietf-types@iana.org Subject: Registration of MIME media type
   application/lumion

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: lumion

   Required parameters: (none) Optional parameters: (none)

   Encoding considerations: (none)

   Security considerations:

     This content type carries a payload with metadata, where the only
     information that can be deduced relates to the Lumion envelope.
     Everything else is encrypted. A Lumion thus is self-contained from
     a security point of view.

   Interoperability considerations: This content type provides a common
   format for transporting data in a secure and privacy-compliant
   manner.

   Published specification: (none)

   Applications which use this media type: Databases

   Additional information: Magic number(s): XXXX File extension(s):
   .lumion (optional)
